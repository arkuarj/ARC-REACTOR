# ARC-REACTOR

We used tensor flow library,which is an open-source software library for dataflow programming across a range of tasks. 
It is a symbolic math library, and is also used for machine learning applications such as neural networks.

Here we used the MNIST database is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various 
image processing systems.The database is also widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning.

To predict the digit written in different styles by training with the mnist dataset with greater accuracy.

It is used in the auditing purposes for digit recognition.
